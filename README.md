# langchainGPT Streamlit Application
This repository contains a Streamlit application that utilizes ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, to create a conversational interface. The application allows users to interact with the AI-powered assistant and receive responses generated by ChatGPT.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- **streamlit** library
- **streamlit_chat** library
- **dotenv** library
- **langchain** library (including the chat_models module and schema module)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install streamlit streamlit_chat dotenv langchain

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory. 

    ```cd repository-name```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

    ```python -m venv venv```

4. Activate the virtual environment (if created).

For Windows:

    venv\Scripts\activate

For Linux/macOS:

    source venv/bin/activate


5. Install the project dependencies.
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

6. Set up environment variables.

Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following line, replacing <OPENAI_API_KEY> with your OpenAI API key:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command:

    streamlit run app.py

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your web browser at **http://localhost:8501**.

The application interface consists of a text input box where you can enter your message and receive responses from the AI-powered assistant. The conversation history is displayed in the main section of the page.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the application by modifying the code in the **app.py** file. Here are a few areas you might consider customizing:

Temperature: The **temperature** parameter in the **ChatOpenAI** constructor determines the randomness of the AI's responses. You can adjust this value to make the responses more focused or more diverse.

System Message: The initial system message displayed in the conversation history can be customized by modifying the **SystemMessage** object in the **init** function.

UI Elements: You can modify the UI elements in the Streamlit sidebar or adjust the styling of the conversation messages by modifying the code in the **main** function.
